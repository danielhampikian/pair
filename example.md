**can you output a diff to change the diff not applied and no dif found in response messages to output in red?**  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
Here's the diff to change the "Diff not applied" and "No diff found in the response" messages to output in red:  

```diff
--- pair.py
+++ pair.py
@@ -98,7 +98,7 @@
             else:
-                print("Diff not applied.")
+                print_formatted_text(FormattedText([("fg:red", "Diff not applied.")]))
         else:
-            print("No diff found in the response.")
+            print_formatted_text(FormattedText([("fg:red", "No diff found in the response.")]))
```

This diff replaces the print statements for the specified messages with `print_formatted_text` to output the text in red.
